<p>You'll find a list of sample implementations in the sidebar on the left side.</p>

<p>The codebase to this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/seriousManual/evolution">Github</a>.<br>Please feel free to use it however you like especially if you find bugs or have some nice ideas for improvements or new implementations. </p>
